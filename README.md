# Unique Usernames
Enter a unique username and see if it has already been taken or it's truly unique.
Using HTML, PHP and mySQL the user can enter a username. If the username has been taken, it will prompt the user to enter a new username. If the username is not taken, it will show a message that the username has been added succesfully to the database
